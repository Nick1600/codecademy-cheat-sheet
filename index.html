                In my limited experience with CSS Grid, and even more limited experience with HTML Tables, I find that in almost every way, the Grid system is more powerful, versatile, and user friendly than HTML tables.

                <p class="html-tables__info">HTML tables are a reasonable easy way to convey information in a table layout using just HTML.There is some functionality that allows customization of the table, but it is pretty limited. You can set the amount of rows, and columns, as well as adding cells that span multiple rows or columns, but that is about the extent of it. Of course, there is pretty limitless customization with CSS.</p>

                <p class="conclusion__info">Hopefully this helps with understanding HTML tables. We have looked at some of the limitations of HTML tables, and also gone over most of the syntax involved.</p>
                <aside class="conclusion__thought">
                    The most compelling argument for HTML tables is their relative ease> However, I would say that the biggest drawback the humble table faces is their non-responsive nature. This is where CSS Grids truly shine strong. But thats a story for another time.
